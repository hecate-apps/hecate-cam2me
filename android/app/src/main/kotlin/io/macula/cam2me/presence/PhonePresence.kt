 * they're currently connected to (up to 3, for redundancy -- see
 * MeshSessionPool) -- against [Contact.phoneNumber]. Never written for a
 * number that isn't a [Contact]; there's nothing to do with presence for a
 * number you haven't added.

 * always read and written as a whole, never queried by individual station
 * -- a JSON column is the honest shape for that, not premature
